# git-modules

this folder will contain the contracts for all the git related projects. Any projects which is planning to keep a 
reference should create a symbol link to the target contract folder. For example. 

```bash
pushd <root>/packages/contracts/bridge-stacks;
ln -s ../alex-stacks/alex-v1 .;
```
